> **Note:** since I retired a few months ago I do not really maintain this package any more. I would be more than happy if an interested party was interested to take over. In the meantime, I have "archived" the repository to clearly signal that there is no maintenance. I would be happy to unarchive it and transfer ownership if someone is interested.

PyRDFA
======


What is it
----------

pyRdfa distiller/parser library. The distribution contains:

- ./pyRdfa: the Python library. You should copy the directory
  somewhere into your PYTHONPATH. Alternatively, you can also run the

    `python setup.py install`

  script in the directory.

- ./scripts/CGI_RDFa.py: can be used as a CGI script to invoke the library.
  It has to be adapted to the local server setup, namely in setting the right paths

- ./scripts/localRdfa.py: script that can be run locally on to transform
  a file into RDF (on the standard output). Run the script with "-h" to
  get the available flags.

- ./Doc-pyRdfa: (epydoc) documentation of the classes and functions

- ./Additional_Packages: some additional packages that are necessary for the library; added here for an easier distribution.
Each of those libraries must be installed separately. Exception is RDFLib that should be installed directly from the server

The package primarily depends on:
 - RDFLib: <http://rdflib.net>. Version 3.2.0 or higher is strongly recommended.
 - html5lib: <https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python> 
 - simplejson: <http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson>  (in the additional packages folder), needed if the JSON serialization is used and if the underlying python version is 2.5 or lower
 - isodate: <http://hg.proclos.com/isodate> (in the additional packages folder) which, in some cases, is missing and RDFLib complains (?)

At the moment, the JSON-LD serialization depends on an external JSON-LD serializer. The package comes with a simple one, but if Niklas Lindstr√∂m's rdflib_jsonld package is available, then this will be used. The former is not really maintained; the latter is in github: https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-jsonld. Note that, eventually, this serializer will find its way to the core RDFLib distribution.
   
The package has been tested on Python version 2.6 and higher and has been adapted to Python 3.
