> **Note:** since I retired a few months ago I do not really maintain this package any more. I would be more than happy if an interested party was interested to take over. In the meantime, I have "archived" the repository to clearly signal that there is no maintenance. I would be happy to unarchive it and transfer ownership if someone is interested.

> **This new version 3.6.0 is now built and maintained on [pyRdfa3](https://prrvchr.github.io/pyrdfa3/)**

For now, the package can only be installed from [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/manage/project/pyRdfa3/releases/) with command `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pyRdfa3`.

PyRDFA
======


What is it
----------

pyRdfa distiller/parser library. The distribution contains:

- ./pyRdfa: the Python library. You should copy the directory somewhere into your PYTHONPATH.
  Alternatively, you can also install from [Test Python Package Index](https://test.pypi.org/manage/project/pyRdfa3/releases/) with command:

    `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pyRdfa3`

- ./scripts/CGI_RDFa.py: can be used as a CGI script to invoke the library.
  It has to be adapted to the local server setup, namely in setting the right paths

- ./scripts/localRdfa.py: script that can be run locally on to transform
  a file into RDF (on the standard output). Run the script with "-h" to
  get the available flags.

- ./doc: (pdoc) documentation of the classes and functions

The package primarily depends on:
- Python version 3.7 or higher
- [rdflib](https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/7.0.0/): version 7.0.0 or higher is strongly recommended.
- [html5lib](https://pypi.org/project/html5lib/1.1/): version 1.1 or higher is strongly recommended.

The package has been tested on Python version 3.7 and higher (no more support for Python 2.x).
